Hello friends! It's been a while, hasn't it? Today, I have a small community contribution. I've spent the last few weeks very briefly reviewing every video on this post, and I've sorted them into various categories as they relate to common penetration testing methodologies. It may not be 100% accurate...but with that stipulation out of the way, I want to chime in my personal thoughts on [Phillip Wylie's](https://twitter.com/PhillipWylie) Pwn School Project. 

I should also take a moment to talk about my relationship with The Pwn School Project. 

> I'm not funded or sponsored in any way by Phillip Wylie or The Pwn School Project. The information herein is not an official syllabus, and should not be regarded as an authoritative source - or representative of the thoughts of Phillip Wylie or The Pwn School Project in any manner. This is simply something I wanted to do to help out the community, and support Phillip after having met with him on [Eric Balardo's](https://twitter.com/ebelardo73) stream in recent times. You can find the link to that stream here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD70RBD9YuQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD70RBD9YuQ)

# Abstract

The Pwn School Project is effectively a free, professional-level, online training and knowledge sharing channel on Youtube based on penetration testing and ethical hacking:

The Pwn School Project was started by Phillip Wylie as a way to help college students further their education in cybersecurity - particularly, in penetration testing methodology, and has now grown to a community of several thousand students spanning from many different backgrounds. If you know me, I'm a huge fan of "stuff/things" that are cheap, but especially things that are free. This is an awesome platform that is inclusive, friendly to newcomers, and has high-quality content...it's really hard for me to criticize anything about it. 

So this pseudo-syllabus is my contribution to you, as well as to The Pwn School Project. If you want to take this from a truly academic approach, I've included a short worksheet at the end with some simple questions to ask yourself about each video (think of it as a sort of homework that doesn't get a grade, and there are no wrong answers).

Please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter if additions/modifications/retractions need to be made, and I'll be happy to get those taken care of.
